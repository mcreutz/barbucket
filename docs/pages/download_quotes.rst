Quotes downloading
==================

To download historical quotes, IB's TWS needs to be running and API access enabled. Then execute

.. code-block:: console

  $ barbucket quotes fetch --universe my_universe

--name             Name of the universe to download quotes for

Restrictions
------------
- Right now, only daily quotes are supported
- Start-date will always be today
- Duration will be 15 years or shorter, if latest existing quote is newer
- IB is enforcing strict speedlimits, so downloading quotes on IB for many contracts will need some time.

Configuration
-------------
Some adjustments to the process can be changed in the ``config.ini`` at

.. code-block:: console

  {your_local_user_directory}/.barbucket/config.ini
